Trends that I observe.

1. The difference between the most popular items and most profitable items is 1 item, and it makes sense because most popular refers the most sell of them and it has correlation with the profits

2. There are less women than men registered purchases so it can be than women are less interested in games

3.People in the (20,24] age group are the most interested group in games, that can be related with the trends corresponding to their ages and with their salary and their free time.
